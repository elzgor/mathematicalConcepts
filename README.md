Playing around with mathematical ideas using Python. A description of each file is given below.


divisibilityByTwoPrimes:

Finds all distinct combinations of two prime numbers which multiply to give a result lower than a user-inputted x. Exponents are also taken into consideration (for example: for a limit of 100, one valid combination is 2 & 11, since (2^3) * 11 = 88 < 100). Returns a list of all combinations as well as the sum of all valid results.


multiplicativeInverse:

Finds the multiplicative inverse of x module m, where both x and m are inputted by the user.
